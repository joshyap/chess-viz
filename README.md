Chess is a sport that is well-known for board game that emphasizes strategy and tactics. It is also known for its [ELO system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system), which is a rating system to quantify how strong players are relative to one another. 

This project utilizes the [chess.com api](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api) in conjunction with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) to visualize the ELO ratings of my individual chess.com account.
